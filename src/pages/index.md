    Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to
    interfere in his life. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're
    dying! Noooooo! Bender, we're trying our best.

    Who are those horrible orange men?

    That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just
    learn to play this stupid thing.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
