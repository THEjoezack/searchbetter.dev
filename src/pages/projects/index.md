        QIT.cloud is a programmer focused podcast discovery service that lets
        you search, queue, and play episodes by topic.

        DevPodcasts.App is another podcast discovery service, but this one is
        geared more towards helping people find podcasts (as opposed to
        episodes) by topic.

        FindTech.events is a developer conference discovery service. It's still
        in it's early days, but the idea is that you will be able to search for
        conferences by topic, date, location, and whether or not the conference
        is currently accepting call-for-proposals.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

      The first time I tried Kaldi’s coffee, I couldn’t even believe that was
      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.

      stance on empowering farmers and transparency.
