![Headshot of the handsome Joe Zack](/img/podcast-face.png "It's a me, Joe Zack!")

I am [Joe Zack](http://joezack.com), a long time software engineer and a host of the [Coding Blocks](https://www.codingblocks.net) podcast.

### I'm great at parties

I simply can't stop talking about the things I love, which includes search engines. In fact, I love search engines so much that Coding Blocks spun this site up for me so I can keep creating search focused content without overwhelming the main feed.

I'd love to hear any feedback you have for me over on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/THEjoezack).

## Oh yeah, about the site

SearchBetter.dev is dedicated to bringing you dev-centered content all about search engines like Elasticsearch.
